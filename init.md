# Project Init: Receptionists.net.au (Antigravity)

## 1. Vision & Core Strategy
- **Primary Value Prop**: "No More Missed Calls."
- **Problem**: Australian small businesses (Tradies, Hospitality, Medical) are losing thousands in "Revenue Leaks" when they are too busy to answer the phone.
- **Solution**: A 24/7 reliable, local (AU/NZ) virtual receptionist service that handles bookings, messages, and enquiries directly.
- **Conversion Angle**: Fear of Loss (Revenue Drain) + Scarcity (Founding 100 Launch Special).

## 2. Brand Guidelines & Aesthetics
- **Core Aesthetic**: High-contrast, bold, editorial, "Chaos vs. Control."
- **Color Palette**:
  - `Slate-950`: Foundation, stability, professional depth.
  - `Orange-600`: Brand action, energy, attention.
  - `Red-600`: Urgency, the "Leak," warning signs.
  - `Green-600`: Success, "Revenue Secured," result status.
- **Typography**: 
  - **Headers**: Outfit (Black/Extra Bold, Italic, Uppercase) for high impact.
  - **Body**: Inter for maximum readability.
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Dashed borders and heavy container weights.
  - "Chaos" imagery (busy kitchens/sites) vs. "Control" UI (clean dashboards).

## 3. Conversion Architecture
- **Hook**: Urgent hero section focused on the financial cost of silence.
- **Logic**: "The Math of a Missed Call" - breaking down specific dollar losses per industry.
- **Trust**: Local AU/NZ team emphasis (counteracting "overseas call center" stigma).
- **Scarcity**: Launch phase pricing ($398/mo locked for life for first 100 partners).
- **Risk Reversal**: No long-term lock-in contracts; "Founding Partner" priority status.

## 4. Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: React 19 (ES6 Modules).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first).
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth entrances and high-end feel.
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent, clean UI language.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first grid layouts for busy business owners on the go.

## 5. Copywriting Hooks
- "Never miss revenue again."
- "Stop the leak."
- "While your kitchen is flat out, we secure the front desk."
- "Voicemails don't win jobs."

## 6. Future Expansion Ideas
- Real-time revenue loss calculator tool.
- Industry-specific landing pages (receptionist.net.au/plumbers, etc.).
- Integration visualizer for specific CRMs (ServiceM8, Cliniko, etc.).
